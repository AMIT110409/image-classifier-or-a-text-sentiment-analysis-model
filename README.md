# image-classifier-or-a-text-sentiment-analysis-model
This project focuses on developing an end-to-end AI model deployment pipeline for both image classification and text sentiment analysis. The system incorporates Python, machine learning, deep learning, Docker, Kubernetes, Flask for API creation, and MySQL for logging prediction requests. Additionally, basic authentication is implemented for API

Key Features:

AI Model Development:

Implement a robust image classifier or text sentiment analysis model using Python and a machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch).
Web Service Creation with Flask:

Develop a Flask-based web service to serve the AI model.
Expose API endpoints for users to submit data and receive predictions.
Containerization with Docker:

Utilize Docker to containerize both the AI model and the Flask web service.
Write a Dockerfile specifying the environment and dependencies.
Deployment with Kubernetes:

Deploy the Docker containers using Kubernetes for scalability and management.
Include configurations for scaling and application management.
MySQL Database Logging:

Implement logging of prediction requests and results in a MySQL database.
Ensure proper data integrity and reliability for logging purposes.
Basic Authentication for API:

Enhance security by implementing basic authentication for API access.
Control access to the API with secure authentication mechanisms.

AI Model Deployment Pipeline
Introduction:
This repository contains the source code and configurations for an AI model deployment pipeline. The project includes an image classifier and a text sentiment analysis model, both served through a Flask-based web service. Docker and Kubernetes are used for containerization and deployment, while MySQL is employed for logging prediction requests. Basic authentication is implemented for API access control.

Project Structure:

/models: Contains the Python scripts for AI model development.
/web_service: Includes the Flask web service code.
/docker: Holds the Dockerfile for containerization.
/kubernetes: Contains Kubernetes deployment configurations.
/database: SQL scripts for MySQL database setup.
Setup Instructions:

Environment Setup:

Install Python, Flask, and the chosen machine learning framework.
Set up a MySQL database with the provided scripts.
Ensure Docker and Kubernetes are installed.
AI Model Development:

Navigate to /models and run the model development scripts.
Train and evaluate the image classifier or text sentiment analysis model.
Web Service Deployment:

Navigate to /web_service and run the Flask web service.
Access the API endpoints for model predictions.
Containerization and Deployment:

Use the Dockerfile in /docker to build containers.
Deploy containers with Kubernetes using configurations in /kubernetes.
MySQL Logging and Basic Authentication:

Configure MySQL connection in the web service for logging.
Explore basic authentication setup in the API.
Usage:

Access the API endpoints for predictions.
Monitor prediction requests and results in the MySQL database.
